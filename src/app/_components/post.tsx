/**
 * Legacy template component placeholder.
 *
 * Why this exists:
 * - Some create-t3-app templates generate demo "post" UI that calls example routers.
 * - PepeFinder doesn’t need it, but deleting files can be annoying during early setup
 *   if other template code imports them.
 *
 * So we turn it into a harmless, lint-clean placeholder.
 * You can delete this later once you remove all imports of it.
